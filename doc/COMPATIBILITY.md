# plx Compatibility

## Supported versions

plx supports PostgreSQL 13 through 18 (released), and builds and passes on the
19 and 20 development lines. The full pg_regress suite (plxruby, plxphp, plxjs,
plxpython3, plxgo, plxcobol, plxplsql, plxts, plxtsql, and the rejection tests)
passes on each of PostgreSQL 13 through 19, plus 20 built from source.

PostgreSQL 19 is covered by CI as of this change, installed from the PGDG
packages rather than built from source, so the packaged beta is exercised on the
same footing as the released majors. It needs no source changes: the build is
clean (no errors, no warnings) and all 13 regression targets pass.

| PostgreSQL | Status | string builder |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| 13 | pass | correct, not accelerated |
| 14 | pass | correct, not accelerated |
| 15 | pass | correct, not accelerated |
| 16 | pass | correct, not accelerated |
| 17 | pass | correct, not accelerated |
| 18 | pass | accelerated (amortized O(1)) |
| 19 (beta) | pass (CI, PGDG packages) | accelerated (amortized O(1)) |
| 20 (devel) | pass (from source) | accelerated (amortized O(1)) |

PostgreSQL 19 and 20 compile with a C23 toolchain (for example gcc 15), where
`pg_noreturn` becomes the standard `[[noreturn]]` attribute; plx writes it as the
first token of each declaration so it compiles across all of these versions.

## The string builder is accelerated only on PostgreSQL 18

plx ships a string builder (`plx_strbuild`) and lowers the dialect string-append
operators onto it, so building a string in a loop is amortized O(1) instead of
the O(n^2) of `s := s || 'x'`. The in-place append relies on
`SupportRequestModifyInPlace`, which was introduced in PostgreSQL 18. On
PostgreSQL 13 to 17 the builder produces correct results, but the append is
O(n^2), the same as plain concatenation, because those versions only let the
built-in array functions take a read-write expanded argument. The transpiler
lowers to the builder on every version (the results are always correct); the
speedup appears when running on PostgreSQL 18. See the
[benchmarks](https://github.com/commandprompt/plx/blob/master/bench/BENCHMARKS.md).

## Why the version range holds

plx binds each dialect language to plpgsql's own call handler, so a plx function
executes as plpgsql. This depends on the plpgsql handler symbols
(`plpgsql_call_handler`, `plpgsql_inline_handler`) being resolvable from another
loaded module. On PostgreSQL 13 to 17 the server is built with default symbol
visibility, so these symbols are global. On PostgreSQL 18 they remain global
because they are the fmgr entry points (declared `PGDLLEXPORT`). The catalog
model plx uses (a language whose `lanplcallfoid` points at plpgsql's handler,
with the dialect body transpiled to plpgsql and stored in `pg_proc.prosrc`) is
unchanged across these versions.

## Source portability

Two server APIs differ across the supported majors; plx handles both:

- `pg_noreturn` is a PostgreSQL 18 prefix specifier. On earlier versions plx
  defines it as the compiler noreturn attribute.
- `pg_b64_encode` changed signature across majors. plx uses a self-contained
  base64 encoder for the embedded original source, so it does not depend on the
  server function.

## Reproducing

`test/pg_matrix.sh` builds PostgreSQL 13 to 17 from source, builds plx against
each `pg_config`, and runs the regression suite per version. Run it as root in a
build environment with the standard PostgreSQL build dependencies installed.

```
test/pg_matrix.sh
cat /root/pg_matrix_summary.txt
```
